# Hi there! ðŸ‘‹

### ðŸ”­ About Me
  - I am currently a first year M.S. in Business Analytics candidate at the University of Iowa
  - I received my undergraduate degree in Accounting and Finance from Virginia Tech in 2018 and went on to work in consulting for KPMG for nearly 3 years
  - As someone who did not have much experience in programming coming from undergrad, I have really enjoyed the opportunity to fully immerse myself in learning new languages and applying them to my areas of interest. I hope to continue to learn and grow while adding projects to this page that showcase my abilities.

 - Basketball Analytics
 - Predictive Analytics Models
 - Simulation Modeling
